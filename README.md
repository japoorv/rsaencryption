# RSA Encryption Implementation in Python

* The above implementation utilized hybrid encryption ie symmetric encryption for the data and assymetric for the cipher key.
* For the assymetric part it uses the AES Implementation of pycrypto.
* For symmetric part the algorithm is implemented

The Symmetric Encryption is implemented using PyCrypto https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/
