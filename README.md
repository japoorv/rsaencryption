# RSA Encryption Implementation in Python

* The above implementation utilizes hybrid encryption ie symmetric encryption for the data and asymmetric for the cipher key.
* For the symmetric part it uses the AES Implementation of pycrypto.
* The asymmetric part the algorithm is implemented in the given files.
# Usage:
* The text to be encrypted must be typed whereas the text to be decrypted should be in a file named encrypted.txt with the corrosponding encrypted symmetric key in key.txt. Both of these are generated automatically when a text is encrypted.

The Symmetric Encryption is implemented using PyCrypto https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/
